Eloquent flagged attributes behavior. Add commonly used flags to models very quick and easy.

## Features

- Designed to work with Laravel Eloquent models
- Each model can has as many flags as required
- Each flag adds global query scopes to models
- Covered with unit tests

## Available flags list

There are 2 types of flags:

- `Boolean` useful when you need to mark entity as active, published, accepted and etc, but you don't care when exactly this action was performed or you are logging user actions by yourself.
- `Timestamp` works the same as `Boolean` flags, but has `null` value instead of `false` and `timestamp` of performed action instead of `true` value. This allows you to retrieve user action time. This allows you to get all records published after your last login.

| Trait name | Database columns | Flag type |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| `HasAcceptedFlag` | `is_accepted` | Boolean |
| `HasActiveFlag` | `is_active` | Boolean |
| `HasKeptFlag` | `is_kept` | Boolean |
| `HasPublishedFlag` | `is_published` | Boolean |
| `HasVerifiedFlag` | `is_verified` | Boolean |
| `HasPublishedAt` | `published_at` | Timestamp |

## How it works

Eloquent Flag is an easy way to add flagged attributes to eloquent models. All flags has their own trait which adds global scopes to desired entity.

The main logic of the flags: If flag is `false` or `null` - entity should be hidden from the query results. Omitted entities could be retrieved by using special global scope methods.  

## Installation

First, pull in the package through Composer.

```shell
composer require cybercog/laravel-eloquent-flag
```

And then include the service provider within `app/config/app.php`.

*// Service provider not using yet. Will be used to boot console commands in future.*

```php
'providers' => [
    Cog\Flag\Providers\FlagServiceProvider::class,
];
```

## Usage

### Setup an activatable model

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Cog\Flag\Traits\HasActiveFlag;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasActiveFlag;
}
```

*Model must have boolean `is_active` column in database table.*

### Available functions

#### Get only active models

```shell
Post::all();
Post::withoutInactive();
```

#### Get only inactive models

```shell
Post::onlyInactive();
```

#### Get active + inactive models

```shell
Post::withInactive();
```

#### Activate model

```shell
Post::where('id', 4)->activate();
```

#### Deactivate model

```shell
Post::where('id', 4)->deactivate();
```

### Setup an acceptable model

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Cog\Flag\Traits\HasAcceptedFlag;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasAcceptedFlag;
}
```

*Model must have boolean `is_accepted` column in database table.*

### Available functions

#### Get only accepted models

```shell
Post::all();
Post::withoutUnaccepted();
```

#### Get only unaccepted models

```shell
Post::onlyUnaccepted();
```

#### Get accepted + unaccepted models

```shell
Post::withUnaccepted();
```

#### Accept model

```shell
Post::where('id', 4)->accept();
```

#### Deactivate model

```shell
Post::where('id', 4)->unaccept();
```

### Setup a publishable model

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Cog\Flag\Traits\HasPublishedFlag;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasPublishedFlag;
}
```

*Model must have boolean `is_published` column in database table.*

### Available functions

#### Get only published models

```shell
Post::all();
Post::withoutUnpublished();
```

#### Get only unpublished models

```shell
Post::onlyUnpublished();
```

#### Get published + unpublished models

```shell
Post::withUnpublished();
```

#### Publish model

```shell
Post::where('id', 4)->publish();
```

#### Unpublish model

```shell
Post::where('id', 4)->unpublish();
```

### Setup a verifiable model

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Cog\Flag\Traits\HasVerifiedFlag;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasVerifiedFlag;
}
```

*Model must have boolean `is_verified` column in database table.*

### Available functions

#### Get only verified models

```shell
Post::all();
Post::withoutUnverified();
```

#### Get only unverified models

```shell
Post::onlyUnverified();
```

#### Get verified + unverified models

```shell
Post::withUnverified();
```

#### Verify model

```shell
Post::where('id', 4)->verify();
```

#### Unverify model

```shell
Post::where('id', 4)->unverify();
```

### Setup a keepable model

Keep functionality required when you are trying to attach related models before parent one isn't persisted in application.

**Issue:**

1. User press `Create Post` button.
2. Create post form has image uploader.
3. On image uploading user can't attach image to post before post entity wouldn't been stored in database.

**Solution:**

1. Add `HasKeptFlag` trait to model (and add boolean `is_kept` column to model's database table).
2. Create empty model on form loading (it will has `is_kept = 0` by default).
3. Feel free to add any relations to the model.
4. Model will be marked as required to be kept as soon as model will be saved\updated for the first time after creation.

**Known limitations:**

- Using this methodology you wouldn't have create form, only edit will be available.
- Not all the models allows to have empty attributes on save. Such attributes could be set as nullable to allow create blank model.  
- To prevent spam of unkept models in database they could be deleted on a predetermined schedule (once a week for example).

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Cog\Flag\Traits\HasKeptFlag;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasKeptFlag;
}
```

Your model is now can be marked to be kept!

*Model must have boolean `is_kept` column in database table.*

By default all records that have a `is_kept` equals to 0 will be excluded from your query results. To include unkept records, all you need to do is call the `withUnkept()` method on your query.

### Available functions

#### Get only kept models

```shell
Post::all();
Post::withoutUnkept();
```

#### Get only unkept models

```shell
Post::onlyUnkept();
```

#### Get kept + unkept models

```shell
Post::withUnkept();
```

#### Keep model

```shell
Post::where('id', 4)->keep();
```

#### Unkeep model

```shell
Post::where('id', 4)->unkeep();
```

#### Get unkept models which older than hours

```shell
Post::onlyUnkeptOlderThanHours(4);
```

Output will have all unkept models created earlier than 4 hours ago.

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```shell
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
